Book Program

Overview

This Java program defines a `Book` class with attributes: name, cover color, author, genre, and number of pages. It creates a `Book` object and displays its details.

Approach

* The `Book` class stores book details.
* The constructor initializes the attributes.
* The `display()` method prints the book info.
* The `main` method creates a `Book` instance and calls `display()`.

## Output
the book's name is: ramayana
the colour of the cover is: blue
the author is: author
the genre is: genre
the amount of pages in this book is: 450
